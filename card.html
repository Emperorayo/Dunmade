    <p>Each and everyday, i miss you. I dont mean to sound whiny or cocky, but i do. And although i think that this day is much overhyped. Things would have turned out very differently if you were around.</p>
<p>I totally understand that the distance between us is just a silly number and that its just a temporary thin. But part of me wishes to celebrate this day of love with you.</p>  
<p>I tried so hard to pass it off as another normal day, but i couldnt. The truth is that i miss you and im waiting fot the day ill get to see you and tell you how much i love you in person. Until then, i guess ill just have to be patient.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, Happy Valentines day, ml. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH</p>
